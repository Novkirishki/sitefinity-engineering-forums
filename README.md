# ForumsApp
Helper app for managing forum requests at work, developed to get started with .NET Core

The app craws existing forums and adds additional features for easier management, since we don`t have access to that system to apply the extensions there.

Features:
- ability to close a thread. Closed threads are those that have been provided a reply and are pending response from the OP. If any new post is available thread is automatically removed the closed status. Only threads which are not marked as answered and have not been marked as closed will be listed
- list all unanswered and opened threads in one page

Todo:
- add ability for team members to assign themsleves to an open forum post.
